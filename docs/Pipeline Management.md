# Pipeline Management: Creating and Managing Data Pipelines for Production

To bring the chatbot use case to production, we need a robust, scalable, and automated system. Below is a detailed proposal to design and manage the data pipelines effectively.

---

## Objectives of the Data Pipeline
1. **Automation**: Automate data ingestion, processing, storage, and inference workflows.
2. **Scalability**: Handle growing data and inference demands with minimal manual intervention.
3. **Monitoring and Reliability**: Track performance, detect issues, and ensure robust recovery mechanisms.
4. **Modularity**: Keep each stage of the pipeline independent for easier updates and maintenance.
5. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate feedback loops for continuous improvement and retraining.

## Pipeline Architecture

In detail explanation for above component diagram:

### **1. Document Ingestion Pipeline**
**Purpose**: Ingest and preprocess shared documents for chunking and vectorization.

- **Sources**:
  - User-uploaded documents via a web interface or API.
  - Batch ingestion from file systems, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), or databases.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Upload/Fetch**:
     - Trigger ingestion when a new document is uploaded or detected in a storage bucket.
  2. **Preprocessing**:
     - Extract text (e.g., `PyPDF2` for PDFs, `python-docx` for Word files).
     - Clean and normalize text (e.g., removing special characters or redundant whitespaces).
  3. **Metadata Extraction**:
     - Capture metadata such as document title, author, and upload timestamp.
  4. **Chunking**:
     - Split text into smaller chunks (e.g., 200-500 tokens) using a tokenizer.
  5. **Embeddings**:
     - Generate embeddings for each chunk using an open-source LLM (e.g., Sentence Transformers, LLaMA embeddings).
  6. **Storage**:
     - Save embeddings and metadata in a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone, or Weaviate).

### **2. Retrieval Pipeline**
**Purpose**: Fetch relevant document chunks for a given query during inference.

- **Steps**:
  1. Receive the user query.
  2. Convert the query into embeddings using the same embedding model as the ingestion pipeline.
  3. Perform a semantic search in the vector database.
  4. Retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks.
  5. Return the retrieved chunks for prompt generation.

---

### **3. LLM Response Pipeline**
**Purpose**: Use the LLM to generate responses based on the user query and retrieved document context.

- **Steps**:
  1. Format the retrieved chunks and user query into a structured prompt.
  2. Send the prompt to the LLM (e.g., via Ollama or a self-hosted inference server).
  3. Return the LLM's response to the user.

---

### **4. Feedback Pipeline**
**Purpose**: Collect feedback to improve the chatbot.

- **Sources**:
  - User feedback ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down).
  - Logs of user queries, retrieved chunks, and LLM responses.

- **Steps**:
  1. Store feedback and logs in a central database.
  2. Periodically analyze feedback to identify common issues (e.g., low relevance, slow responses).
  3. Use feedback to retrain models or improve retrieval configurations.

---

### **5. Retraining Pipeline**
**Purpose**: Automatically retrain the system when performance degrades.

- **Trigger Points**:
  - Data drift detection (e.g., new document types or topics).
  - Poor user feedback metrics.

- **Steps**:
  1. Use logs and feedback as new training data.
  2. Fine-tune the LLM or retrain the embedding model.
  3. Reindex the vector database with updated embeddings.

## Pipeline Management Method

### **1. Orchestration**
- Use a workflow orchestration tool like **Apache Airflow**, **Prefect**, or **Dagster**.
- Define tasks for ingestion, retrieval, inference, and feedback handling as separate DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).

### **2. Data Storage**
- Use cloud storage for raw documents and preprocessed text.
- Store embeddings and metadata in a vector database.
- Store logs and feedback in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

### **3. Monitoring**
- Use tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor latency, throughput, and system errors.
- Implement alerting for critical issues like pipeline failures or degraded performance.

### **4. Scalability**
- Deploy components as microservices using Kubernetes or Docker for scalability.
- Use load balancers to handle high query volumes.

### **5. Versioning and Reproducibility**
- Use **DVC** (Data Version Control) or **MLflow** for model and dataset versioning.
- Track changes to pipeline configurations in Git.

### **6. CI/CD for Updates**
- Automate testing and deployment of pipeline updates using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- Ensure new models or pipeline changes are tested with a validation dataset before deployment.

## Sample Workflow in Production
1. A user uploads a document via the web interface.
2. The ingestion pipeline extracts and processes the document, stores chunks in the vector database, and updates metadata.
3. A user sends a query.
4. The retrieval pipeline fetches relevant chunks from the vector database.
5. The inference pipeline formats the chunks and query into a prompt, sends it to the LLM, and returns the response.
6. User feedback is logged and stored for future retraining.

## Tools and Technologies

1. **Vector Database**: ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate.
2. **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Prefect, Dagster.
3. **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana.
4. **Storage**:
   - Cloud Storage: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.
   - Logs and Feedback: PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch.
5. **LLM Hosting**: Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain.
6. **Version Control**: Git, DVC, MLflow.
7. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins.

## Benefits of the Proposed Method
- **Scalability**: The pipeline is modular, allowing independent scaling of ingestion, retrieval, and inference.
- **Reliability**: Continuous monitoring and feedback loops ensure robust performance.
- **Automation**: Workflow orchestration reduces manual intervention.
- **Version Control**: Ensures reproducibility and auditability of pipeline changes.
