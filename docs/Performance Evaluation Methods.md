## Performance Evaluation Methods:
- **Feedback Collection:**
    - Add a user feedback mechanism for each response to collect explicit ratings.
    Example: "Was this answer helpful? Yes/No."

- **A/B Testing:**
    - Deploy multiple versions of the chatbot (e.g., with different LLMs or fine-tuning strategies) and measure performance under real-world conditions.

- **Automated Evaluation:**
    - Use benchmark datasets with known questions and answers to periodically test chatbot performance.
    - Metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or F1 can help quantify similarity between expected and actual responses.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation:**
    - Periodically have human evaluators review responses to ensure quality.

- **Drift Detection:**
    - Monitor changes in input data distribution (e.g., new question types or topics).
    - If the input deviates from the training data, it might signal model degradation.
